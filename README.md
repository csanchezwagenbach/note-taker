## Usage
Upon navigating to the home page, a user will see the following screen displayed. ![Home page](./public/assets/images/Screenshot_20230109_032451.png)

Upon clicking the "Get Started" button, a user will be taken to the following page. If no previous notes have been saved, users will see an identical page to the screenshot below. Otherwise, notes previously written and saved will populate the page. ![No saved notes](./public/assets/images/Screenshot_20230109_032511.png)

Once the user has populated both the "Note title" and "Note text" fields with text inputs, a save icon will appear next to the "New Note" button at the top right of the page. The following screenshot demonstrates the appearance of the save button once both fields have been populated with text. ![Save a new note](./public/assets/images/Screenshot_20230109_032553.png)

Saved notes will populate the column on the left side of the page. Should a user click any of the notes in the list, that given note will automatically populate both the "Note title" and "Note text" section, as seen in the screenshot attached below. Additionally, each saved not has a delete button attached to it that will delete the note in question upon a user clicking the button. ![Saved notes](./public/assets/images/Screenshot_20230109_032651.png)
